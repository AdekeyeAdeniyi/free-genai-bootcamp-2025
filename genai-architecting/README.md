# GenAI Lang Port: AI-Powered Japanese Learning System

## **Functional Requirements**

The **GenAI Lang Port** aims to provide an AI-driven platform for users of all levels to learn Japanese through structured lessons, chatbot interactions, and gamification. The system will be **online**, ensuring accessibility to students, self-learners, kids, and parents.

### **Learning Activities Supported:**

- Vocabulary building
- Text adventure
- Writing practice
- Grammar exercises
- Pronunciation training (speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
- Conversational AI for real-time interactions

## **System Architecture**

### **Architecture Components**

1. **User Roles:**

   - **Learner:** Engages with AI-driven lessons and exercises.
   - **AI Assistant:** The primary interface for chatbot-based learning.
   - **Instructor (Optional):** May provide additional learning support.

2. **AI Model & Processing:**

   - Uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT, Llama, or a fine-tuned Japanese language model.
   - Speech processing for pronunciation feedback.
   - Adaptive learning based on user progress.

3. **Gamification Elements:**

   - Progress tracking (badges, points, streaks)
   - Interactive quizzes and challenges
   - AI-driven conversation practice

4. **Backend & API Integration:**
   - Handles **authentication, progress tracking, and lesson structuring**.
   - APIs for **speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and AI-based tutoring**.
5. **Data Storage:**
   - Cloud-based user progress storage.
   - Secure data encryption for privacy compliance.

## **Data Flow**

1. **User submits a request** (e.g., a question, lesson inquiry, or conversation input).
2. **Input is processed** through guardrails to filter inappropriate or irrelevant content.
3. **AI Model analyzes** the request and generates a response.
4. **Gamification & tracking** update user progress based on response accuracy.
5. **Feedback is provided** with hints, corrections, and additional practice suggestions.

## **Requirements, Risks, Assumptions, & Constraints**

### **Requirements:**

- Must be accessible **on any device** with a browser.
- Supports **structured lessons and conversational AI**.
- Tracks **user progress** and provides adaptive feedback.
- Must provide an **engaging and interactive learning experience**.

### **Risks:**

- AI-generated responses may not always be **100% accurate**.
- **Server costs** may increase with more users.
- Users may require **technical support** for accessing features.

### **Assumptions:**

- Users have **basic technical literacy**.
- Learners may have **some prior Japanese knowledge** or start as complete beginners.
- The AI model used has **strong Japanese language capabilities**.

### **Constraints:**

- Must operate **entirely online** (no offline support initially).
- Limited to **Japanese language learning at beginner to intermediate levels (JLPT N5-N4)**.
- Requires **internet connection** for AI processing.

## **Infrastructure Design**

- **Cloud-based architecture** for scalability.
- **Web-based platform** (desktop & mobile-friendly).
- **APIs for AI interactions, user tracking, and gamification**.
- **Data encryption and compliance with privacy regulations**.

## **Data Strategy**

- Stores **lesson progress, user scores, and interaction history** securely.
- No personal data sharing with external services.
- AI **improves over time** with feedback mechanisms.

## **Business Considerations**

### **Cost Considerations:**

- Possible **subscription model** or freemium access with **premium features**.
- Minimal ongoing costs apart from **cloud hosting and AI API usage**.

### **Lock-in Prevention:**

- Uses **open-source AI models** where possible to **avoid vendor lock-in**.
- Ensures **data portability** for users to export their learning progress.

### **Key Benefits:**
